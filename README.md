# Sentry Plugin for JetBrains IDEs

The Sentry plugin allows you to browse issues, events, and stacktraces right in your IDE.

Here's what you can do with it:
- Browse issues and events
- Filter issues and sort them just as you would in Sentry
- View stacktraces and navigate to the source code
- Assign issues to yourself or to other users
- Resolve, ignore, or bookmark issues
